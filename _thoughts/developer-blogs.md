Blog post [Your words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted) from Scott Hanselman's blog on August 19, 2012.

## Takeaways
- Developers should be blogging.
- Developers who blog, could probably be posting more.
- Content should be open to the Nets; not restricted to "walled gardens" (internal company sites or platforms like Twitter?).
- Developer content is the "Engine of the Community."

## Questions
- What bright spots can come from these recommendations?
- Does blogging help developers focus on the "how" over the "what"?
    - i.e. discussing what was fascinating or insightful, versus just showing that something can be done and move on.
- Can this help developers with learning and mastery of their craft?
- Would this help developers get more comfortable with openness, transparency, and vulnerability?
- Could this make us better communicators?
