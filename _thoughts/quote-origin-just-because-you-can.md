> "Just because you can, doesnâ€™t mean you should."
> -- unknown

This quote or phrase is probably my most used when discussing technology, especially software development. I've marked it as "unknown" because I'm not exactly sure where I picked it up or to whom it is attributed.

As part of some great leadership training over the last few years, I now understand why it's important to understand and think about the origins of the quotes and phrases we use.
