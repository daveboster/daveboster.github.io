After our small (but mighty) five-person software company, NewFire Group, decided to join a much larger organization with a similar vision and mission, it wasn't long before I asking myself, "What is it, exactly, that a Development Manager is supposed to do?".

As a software developer and small business owner, I thought I had nailed down the essentials for managing a team of talented software developers.
- We had developed a great hiring process, based on the book "[Who: The A Method of Hiring](https://whothebook.com)" by Dr. Geoff Smart and Randy Street. 
- We had established a career path and salary expections based on ​the great work and generousity of Paul Stovell at Octopus Deploy.​ 
  - Note: while the original blog post is no longer available, Paul and Octopus Deploy still make public their Career & Compensation polices online in the [Octopus Handbook](https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/career).


I quickly found out what got me here, wasn't going to get me to where I was going. It was a struggle to say the least and I've got a may more people to thank and invaluable resources to share.

In the middle of this struggle, Dave Royce sent me a link to a video he had watched from a conference about Dvelopment Management. This one video has led to so many wonderful things.

This amazing presetation has helped me frame my thoughts around development leadership at a large organization and discover the CircleCI Engineering Competency Matrix.
