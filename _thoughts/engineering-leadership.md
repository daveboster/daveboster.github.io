After our small (but mighty) five-person software company, NewFire Group, decided to join a much larger organization with a matching vision and mission, it wasn't long before I asked myself, "What am I supposed to do as a Development Manager?".

As a software developer and small business owner, I thought I had nailed down the essentials for managing a team of talented software developers.

- We developed a great hiring process, based on the book "[Who: The A Method of Hiring](https://whothebook.com)" by Dr. Geoff Smart and Randy Street.
- We had established a career path and salary expectations based on ​the great work and generosity of Paul Stovell at Octopus Deploy.​
  - Note: while the original blog post is no longer available, Paul and Octopus Deploy still make public their Career & Compensation policies online in the [Octopus Handbook](https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/career).

I began to realize that what got me here, wasn't going to be all I needed to get where I was going. It was a struggle, to say the least, but a starting point for something new. I was now part of an amazing organization, which emphasized trust and respect, servant leadership, transparency, and learning.

In the middle of this struggle, Dave Royce sent me a link to a video about Development Management. This one video has led to so many wonderful things. This amazing presentation has helped me frame my thoughts around development leadership at a large organization and discover the CircleCI Engineering Competency Matrix. Thank you, Dave!!
