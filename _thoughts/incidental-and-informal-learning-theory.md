Discussing with a colleague how we have been iterating on "Tech Talks" within our development teams (future backlink should go here), I learned there's a theory for it called "Incidental and Informal Learning." For now, I've included a section below to give a brief on a tech talk.

How fascinating! ＼(๏◡๏)／ 

## What is Informal Learning?
There's an article from Emma O'Neill on LearnUpon.com that answers this question, [What is Informal Learning?](https://www.learnupon.com/blog/informal-learning/).

More to come as I unpack this.

## 'Tech Talk' Brief

Our goal was to help with the understanding and adoption of Test-Driven Development (TDD). We started by licensing videos from Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) and his fanstatic [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com) website and then held an internal "Tech Talk" with an internal group of developers.

I love to iterate and discover, so though a series of "tech talks," we came to the following format:

- Length: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Split video into three segments, each segment consisting of:
    - Watch the video together (15-20 mins)
    - Split into random-ish breakout groups (no more than 5-6 per group) (10-15 mins)
      - go around the group and share 1-3 things that came to mind; "skepticism is encouraged"
      - have a group representative either remember (or write down) a few points to bring back to the larger group.
    - Come back together and have each group share the "gist" of their conversation (great if you can share it in chat as well)
- Wrap-up (5-10mins) - what's a "how fascinating!" moment or takeaway, and any action over the next two weeks as a result?
