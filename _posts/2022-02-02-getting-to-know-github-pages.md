I’ve decided to investigate GitHub Websites in search of a method to work on communication and reflection. Writing journal entries is useful, however, I will usually end up using these as a dumping ground for links, thoughts, and pictures. Just by publishing these I will need to find a balance between efficiency and clarity.

Though this attempt, I am hoping to accomplish the following objectives, in order of importance:
1. Improve my communication skills by learning how to use written words to most efficiently describe:
	- Problem 
	- Insight into my thought process
	- Result
2. Reflect on lessons learned
3. Explore the use of GitHub Pages as an effective tool for Software Developers to communicate who they are and to offer a tool to assist them with introspection and continual learning.

## Beginning the Journey
I want to immediately just get started and it was painful to write out the “what” and “why” for this first entry. I am pretty sure it was always in my head, but it took a concerted effort to pull it out, clean it off, and putting it to text.

## About GitHub Pages
To get started, I’m using the [GitHub Pages QuickStart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).  After skimming the first section of the QuickStart, I’m ready to get started.

After the first few steps and about ten clicks, here’s what I have found:
- A pages repository setup, but without any content
- Encryption (HTTPS/SSL) is not enforced by default
- There is no 3-click wizard to get me up and running

After a bit more patience and completing the “Creating your website” section of the QuickStart, I have a nice looking website.

Now comes the  hard part... what do I want to add for content? My first hour on this project has flown by, so content will need to be the topic for another day.  

Shoutout to GitHub. I have to admit I did not expect to have a working website with a fitting design and color scheme within the first hour.

## Result
I have a web presence! The best feature is that anyone can get their information on the nets without having to sign-up for hosting plans, configure cloud infrastructure or complex pipelines. 

It’s been a while since I’ve been able to do a “hello world” type of project. It feels good to try something new and give a salute to an old friend an mentor, Mr. Daniel Turek!

## Lessons Learned
- GitHub Sites offers a good selection of quality themes to use out of the box.
- Markdown is a much nicer experience than a text editor and HTML  I remember from the 1990’s.
- Sites allow you to focus effort on content (what/why) and not the technology (how).

### Next Steps and Thoughts
- Explore ways to manage content on this site, such as a blog, biography, etc.
- Integrating with other tools and markdown editors to support different flows and preferences.
- Can I get this first post on my new GitHub Site?
