I'm a crazy individual who loves to spend time with my family, leverage technology to help others, try some impossible things, and then see how much I can fit in 24 hours.

In the process of evaluating [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), I'm testing out the [Jekyll Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) to see if these will help save brain cycles thinking about structure and layout. Instead, I want to find ways for users to focus on content.

To complete this MVP, here's some information from my first page that I'd like to include to see some additional content in a post. This might make it more likely for me to update and evolve main page.

### Hello Mr. Turek, I am here!

This is my version of "Hello World", a line used by many programmers when getting started. Dan Turek taught Math and Computer Science at Burke High School and through some small, but impactful moments, helped shape my path in programming and technology.

### The MVP of Personal Websites

My vision for this site is to create a resource to help me process my thoughts and possibly help others.

I hope to explore the use of GitHub Pages as an effective tool for Software Developers to advocate for their public identity, to offer a tool to assist them with introspection, and to promote continual learning through an employer-agnostic repository of information.

In the process of doing all of this, I'd like to improve my communication skills through the disciplined writing and management of a public website tied to my name. ðŸ˜¬
