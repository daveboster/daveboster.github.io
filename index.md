## Hello and Salutations

My wife Janet and I are blessed with four amazing kiddos, which we are fervently preparing to unleash into the wild, so we can watch in wonder as they grow and make their positive dents on the world!

I like to dream big, try some impossible things, collaborate and share with others, ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù constantly, and challenge what I see around me.

I‚Äôm a curious and passionate professional software developer [manager] looking to help guide software development and the use of technology, particularly within healthcare, so to help us be more *human*, more *effective*, and more *intentional*! I am committed to continual improvement and helping other software professionals through the relentless pursuit of mastery in Clean Coding practices and the Extreme Programming (XP) principles of Test-Drive Development (TDD), Refactoring, Pairing, and Simple Design.

My favorite leaders whose works I continue study today include thought leaders like [Jim Collins](https://www.jimcollins.com), [Bren√© Brown](https://brenebrown.com), [Simon Sinek](https://www.linkedin.com/simonsinek), and [Jocko Willink](https://jocko.com); software visionaries like [Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)](https://cleancoders.com), [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com), and [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net).

## Why this website?

My vision for this site is to create a place to help me process my thoughts and improve my communication skills through disciplined writing and management of a public website that is tied directly to my name. üò¨

I originally started this as an experiment with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in hopes to find a simple way for Software Developers to promote their accomplishments beyond a resume; to assist with growth and continual learning through an employer-agnostic repository of information.
